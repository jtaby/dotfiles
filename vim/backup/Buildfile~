# SPROUTCORE CONFIGURATION FILE
# Use this file to customize the URLs, source and output paths and and other
# options used by the SproutCore build system to create the output for your
# SproutCore applications.
 
# If you want to use the libraries provided by other gems, require those gems
# here.  SproutCore will automatically locate and load any bundles found in
# your load path.  The sproutcore gem is automatically loaded for you.
#
# require 'sproutcore'
 
# This configuration section will be applied to all bundles used by your
# application, even bundles that come from other gems.

  # Name any other frameworks your bundles depend upon.  The stylesheets and
  # JavaScript for required bundles will be loaded before your bundle on your
  # page.

  # This string will be prepended before any URLs that reference JavaScript,
  # CSS or images in your files.

  # This string will be prepended before any index.html urls that actually
  # load your clients.  Setting this to an empty string will mount all
  # of your clients at the root URL level.

  # If you want to use a default root layout template other than the default
  # provided by SproutCore, you can specifiy the path name to the index.html
  # here.  If you provide a relative path, SproutCore will assume the file
  # is relative to the root of this project.
